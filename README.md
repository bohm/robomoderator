# robomoderator

A Discord janitor bot for any of the housekeeping tasks that I need to be done automatically on my own community Discord servers.
Currently the portability is quite low, as it only does what I need it to do. But feel free to use it or remix it!

Related in spirit to https://github.com/bohm/R6RankBot , except I am trying to keep RankBot's functionality fairly limited, whereas this bot
does all the housekeeping that needs to be done.
